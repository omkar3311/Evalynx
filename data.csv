"There are two examination rooms A and B. If 10 students are sent from A to B, then the number of students in each room is the same. If 20 candidates are sent from B to A, then the number of students in A is double the number of students in B. The number of students in room A is:";20;80;100;200;C;Algebra;"Let the number of students in rooms A and B be A and B.<br><br>From the first condition:<br>A − 10 = B + 10<br>⇒ A − B = 20 ...(1)<br><br>From the second condition:<br>A + 20 = 2(B − 20)<br>⇒ A + 20 = 2B − 40<br>⇒ A = 2B − 60 ...(2)<br><br>Substitute (2) in (1):<br>(2B − 60) − B = 20<br>⇒ B = 80<br><br>Then A = B + 20 = 100.<br><br>So, the number of students in room A is 100."
"The price of commodity X increases by 40 paise every year, while the price of commodity Y increases by 15 paise every year. If in 2001, the price of commodity X was Rs. 4.20 and that of Y was Rs. 6.30, in which year will commodity X cost 40 paise more than commodity Y?";2010;2011;2012;2013;B;Linear Equations;"Let the number of years after 2001 be n.<br><br>Price of X after n years = 4.20 + 0.40n<br>Price of Y after n years = 6.30 + 0.15n<br><br>Given that X costs 40 paise more than Y:<br>4.20 + 0.40n = 6.30 + 0.15n + 0.40<br><br>⇒ 0.25n = 2.50<br>⇒ n = 10<br><br>Year = 2001 + 10 = 2011."
"If a - b = 3 and a² + b² = 29, find the value of ab.";10;12;15;18;A;Algebra;"We know that:<br>(a − b)² = a² + b² − 2ab<br><br>Substitute the given values:<br>3² = 29 − 2ab<br>⇒ 9 = 29 − 2ab<br><br>⇒ 2ab = 20<br>⇒ ab = 10.<br><br>So, the value of ab is 10."
