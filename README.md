# Evalynx – AI-Powered Mock Interview Platform

Evalynx is an AI-powered mock interview platform designed to simulate real technical interviews for Machine Learning and Data Science roles.  
It uses **FastAPI**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **Ollama (Mistral 7B)** to conduct interviews, evaluate answers, and generate structured feedback.

The system dynamically selects questions, retrieves authoritative reference answers, and evaluates candidate responses using a large language model under strict scoring rules.

## 🚀 Features

- AI-driven technical interviews
- Dynamic question selection
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for factual grounding
- Strict per-question scoring
- Structured feedback generation
- Timed interview questions
- Voice-based AI interviewer
- Speech-to-text answer input

## 🧩 Build Interviews for Any Domain

Evalynx is **domain-independent**.

You can create interviews for **any field** (Data Science, Backend, DevOps, Cybersecurity, Finance, Medicine, etc.) by simply providing a new knowledge file.

### How It Works
- Create a new text file (e.g., `data.txt`)
- Add question–answer pairs in the format:
Q: <your question>
A: <reference answer>
- Replace the existing data file
- Restart the application

The system automatically:
- Encodes the new data
- Builds vector embeddings
- Selects relevant questions
- Evaluates answers using the same scoring logic

No code changes are required.

## 🔄 Interview Workflow

1. User enters their name and starts the interview
2. A new interview session is created
3. Five questions are selected dynamically from the knowledge base
4. For each question:
   - The AI interviewer reads the question aloud
   - A 60-second timer is started
   - The candidate responds via voice or text
   - Answers are recorded and stored
5. Reference answers are retrieved using vector similarity search
6. After the final question:
   - All responses are evaluated by the LLM
   - Each question is scored out of 2
   - A total score out of 10 is computed
   - Detailed per-question feedback is generated
7. Final evaluation is presented to the candidate

## 🧪 Evaluation Methodology

- Each question carries exactly **2 marks**
- Total score is calculated out of **10**
- Partial scoring is allowed (0, 1, or 2)
- Evaluation is based strictly on retrieved reference answers
- Unanswered questions automatically receive a score of 0
- Feedback is concise, technical, and interview-oriented
