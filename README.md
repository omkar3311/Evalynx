# Evalynx – AI-Powered Mock Interview Platform

Evalynx is an AI-powered mock interview platform designed to simulate real technical interviews for Machine Learning and Data Science roles.  
It uses **FastAPI**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **Ollama (Mistral 7B)** to conduct interviews, evaluate answers, and generate structured feedback.

The system dynamically selects questions, retrieves authoritative reference answers, and evaluates candidate responses using a large language model under strict scoring rules.
